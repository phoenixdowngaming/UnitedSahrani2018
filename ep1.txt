At 09:00 hours this morning, the U.S. Ambassador to United Sahrani (Robert Hale) opened a summit with the leaders of United Sahrani and the Sierra Masbete Rebels.
The Rebels claim ancestral ownership of large portions of the Northern portion of the province.  The goal of the summit was to broker a piece treaty between the two factions.

Around 16:00 hours we received word that the talks had failed to produce any results and the delegates were breaking for the day.  At 16:08 we received a report
of shots fired in the compound were the summit was being held. The Ambassador was safely evacuated to the Embassy compound but we have lost contact since.

Since then we have received a steady stream of reports from across the entire province that order has broken down and the streets have become a battlezone
of fighting between the Sierra Masbete Rebels and the United Sahrani forces.  It now appears to be all out war between the two sides.


Objective:  Extract the Ambassador from the compound
U.S. Mission Compound - 140076

Rules of Engagement:  Do no fire unless fired upon.  We must do what it takes to get the Ambassador out alive but our goal is to stay neutral in the conflict.
